## 🧭 Overview

This project explores how nonprofits can use data analytics to improve donor engagement, retention, and campaign effectiveness. Using a synthetically generated but realistic dataset, we demonstrate how to apply behavioral segmentation, performance evaluation, and impact alignment to inform data-driven decision-making in the nonprofit sector.

## 📌 Key Objectives

- Understand donor behavior through recency, frequency, and monetary value analysis.
- Apply custom RFM segmentation to identify and profile distinct donor groups.
- Analyse engagement history to uncover communication effectiveness by segment.
- Evaluate fundraising campaign performance and link it to mission-driven impact.
- Recommend actionable strategies to enhance donor retention and campaign ROI.

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure

The project uses a structured relational dataset composed of six key tables:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `donors.csv` | Donor profiles including type, region, and join status |
| `donations.csv` | Individual donation records with amount and date |
| `donations_linked.csv` | Donations mapped to specific campaigns |
| `campaigns.csv` | Fundraising campaign details including goals and actuals |
| `impact.csv` | Mission impact metrics per campaign and region |
| `engagement_history.csv` | Donor communications with outcomes (e.g., engaged, unsubscribed) |
